-->Introduction to Objects:
    In JavaScript,Object is most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
    These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types- while these primitive data-types all store a single value each.
-->Internal Representation:
    To understand this rather abstract definition, let us look at an example of a JavaScript Object :
    let school = {
      name : " Ashram Public School",
      location : "Kakinada",
      established : "1971"
      }
      In the above example “name”, “location”, “established” are all “keys” 
      and “Ashram Public School”, “Kakinada” and 1971 are values of these keys respectively.
      
      Each of these keys is referred to as properties of the object. 
      An object in JavaScript may also have a function as a member, in which case it will be known as a method of that object.
